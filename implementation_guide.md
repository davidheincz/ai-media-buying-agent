```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r facebook_ads_manager/requirements.txt
pip install -r deepseek_integration/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Set up the following environment variables:

```
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=your_facebook_app_id
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=your_facebook_app_secret
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

## Meta Marketing API Integration

The Meta Marketing API integration consists of three main components:

### Enhanced Meta API Client

The `enhanced_manager.py` file provides a robust client for interacting with the Meta Marketing API:

- **Authentication**: Handles access tokens, token refresh, and System User authentication
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with retries and rate limit management
- **API Methods**: Complete set of methods for all required API endpoints

Key features include:

- Long-lived token management
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Detailed error reporting
- Support for all campaign management operations

### Ad Management Functions

The `ad_management.py` file provides high-level functions for managing Facebook ads:

- **Campaign Management**: Create, read, update, and delete campaigns
- **Ad Set Management**: Manage ad sets with advanced targeting options
- **Ad Creative Management**: Create and manage ad creatives
- **Reporting**: Comprehensive reporting and analytics

### Routes Integration

The `routes.py` file integrates the Meta API with the web application:

- **Blueprint Registration**: Creates a Flask Blueprint for Meta API routes
- **Authentication Flow**: Handles Facebook OAuth authentication
- **Campaign Management**: Routes for managing campaigns, ad sets, and ads
- **AI Integration**: Routes for AI evaluation and optimization

## Autonomous Decision Engine

The Autonomous Decision Engine (`autonomous_engine.py`) is the core of the AI Media Buying Agent:

### Analysis Capabilities

- **Campaign Analysis**: Analyzes campaign performance against KPIs
- **Budget Recommendations**: Suggests budget adjustments based on performance
- **Ad Set Evaluation**: Evaluates ad set performance and suggests status changes
- **Targeting Analysis**: Analyzes demographic performance and suggests targeting refinements
- **Bidding Strategy**: Recommends optimal bidding strategies
- **Creative Analysis**: Identifies top and bottom performing creatives

### Decision Framework

- **Rule-Based Decisions**: Makes decisions based on configurable rules

5. Configure the Meta API client

### AWS Deployment

1. Set up an EC2 instance
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure environment variables
4. Set up a database
5. Configure NGINX and SSL

## Security Considerations

Ensure the security of your AI Media Buying Agent:

- **API Keys**: Securely store all API keys as environment variables
- **Access Tokens**: Implement secure token storage and refresh
- **User Authentication**: Implement proper user authentication and authorization
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data in the database
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

### Meta API Connection Issues

- **Invalid Access Token**: Refresh the access token or reconnect to Facebook
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff and retry logic
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure the app has the required permissions

### Autonomous Engine Issues

- **No Recommendations**: Ensure campaigns have sufficient data
- **Execution Failures**: Check API permissions and campaign status
- **Performance Issues**: Adjust performance thresholds

### DeepSeek Integration Issues

- **API Key Issues**: Verify the DeepSeek API key is valid
- **Document Processing Errors**: Check document format and content
- **Knowledge Extraction Issues**: Ensure documents contain relevant information
